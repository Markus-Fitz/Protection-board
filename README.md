# Protection-board
 Speaker-protection board for power amplifier.

# Description
 The board includes a relay that connects or disconnects the speakers from the amplifiers. The circuit includes a delay function to avoid initial transients to damage the speakers, a DC-detection to protect the speakers in case of a failing output stage or wrong DC-adjustment and a temperature-sensing circuit which disconnects the speakers from the amplifiers in case of overtemperature.
